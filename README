= Dictionaries for Lojban spell checking

These are ultra-basic dictionaries for Lojban, based on ANSI characters (~= latin alphabet).
The result is clearly simplistic, of poor quality, and maybe inaccurate. But still better than nothing!

- OXT file: LibreOffice / OpenOffice extension
- opera/jbo.zip: Opera-compatible dictionary (instructions to come...)
- jbo.dic, jbo.aff: Hunspell / Myspell files

Feel free to participate.
