# Dictionaries for Lojban spell checking

These are ultra-basic dictionaries for Lojban, based on ANSI characters (~= latin alphabet).
The result is clearly simplistic, of poor quality, and maybe inaccurate. But still better than nothing!

- libreoffice: LibreOffice / OpenOffice extension
- opera: Opera-compatible dictionary (instructions to come...)
- firefox: Firefox extension
- hunspell: Hunspell / Myspell files

Feel free to participate.
